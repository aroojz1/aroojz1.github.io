Born and raised in Baltimore, I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 2025 with a B.S. in Information Systems. Growing up surrounded by healthcare professionals, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the fieldâ€”but not necessarily as a doctor. Instead, I found a way to blend my passion for technology with my interest in healthcare.

I aspire to become a Product Manager, as I believe my strengths align with the cross-functional and vision-driven nature of the position. I seek to combine the technical skills and knowledge gained from my B.S. with my work experience in business and my background in technology.

I am an avid football fan and a sports enthusiast in general. I love solo travel and enjoy hiking and fishing as hobbies.
