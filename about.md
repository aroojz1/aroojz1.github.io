Born and raised in Alipur Pakistan, I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, graduating in 2026. Surrounded by a family passionate about helping others, I became fascinated by how data and technology can transform healthcare—not from a clinical side, but through analytics and innovation.

Over the past few years, I’ve developed skills in data analysis, SQL, Python, Power BI, and machine learning, and I’m especially interested in how data can be used to improve patient outcomes and support evidence-based healthcare decisions. I aim to build a career as a Healthcare Data Analyst, using insights and technology to make real-world impact.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring botany, reading fiction books, and spending time outdoors. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on meaningful projects that connect data, technology, and human wellbeing.
