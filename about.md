I love **movies** that make you think, which is why **Christopher Nolan’s** films are some of my favorites. There’s something about the way he blends complex storytelling with stunning visuals that keeps me hooked. When I’m not watching movies, I’m probably catching up on **anime**—**_Attack on Titan_** is at the top of my list with its intense action and deep themes.  

**Food** is another passion of mine, and I can never resist a good **Italian** or **Afghan** meal. There’s just something comforting about a plate of pasta or a well-seasoned kebab. I also have a strong interest in **electric cars**—innovation and sustainability in the auto industry fascinate me, and I love seeing how technology is shaping the future of transportation.  

When it comes to **sports**, I’m all in on **football**. As a dedicated **Baltimore Ravens** fan, I follow every game and love the energy that comes with it. But I don’t just watch sports—I like staying active, too. During my time at **CCBC**, I was a board member of the **rock climbing club**, where I got to challenge myself and help others get into the sport. More recently, I’ve developed a love for **pickleball**—it’s fast, competitive, and a great way to stay moving.  

**Music** is a huge part of my life. I’m especially drawn to **film scores**, and **Hans Zimmer** and **Ludwig Göransson** are two of my favorite composers. Their music has this way of making any moment feel cinematic. When I want to unwind, I turn to **books**, and **sci-fi** is my go-to genre. **_I, Robot_** is a personal favorite—it’s a classic that always makes me think about the future of AI and technology.  

These are just a few of the things that make me who I am. Whether I’m analyzing data, watching a great film, or playing a game of pickleball, I like to keep a balance between my interests and always stay curious about what’s next.
