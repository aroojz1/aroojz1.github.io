In this [project](https://www.beyonceweekumbc.org/sneaker-trade-dress), I interviewed **[Kenneth Anand](https://jayaramlaw.com/kenneth-anand/)**, former General Counsel of **Kanye Westâ€™s YEEZY Apparel**, to explore the intricacies of **trade dress infringement** in sneaker design. The project centered around analyzing intellectual property (IP) components such as trade dress, logos, trademarks, and patents, with a focus on identifying design similarities and potential conflicts.




I developed a **framework** for identifying design similarities between sneaker brands, providing a clear methodology for detecting potential intellectual property infringement. As part of this effort, I delivered a **detailed report** that offered actionable insights to help sneaker brands protect the originality of their designs and avoid legal conflicts.
