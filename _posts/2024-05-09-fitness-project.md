As the lead developer of *My Fitness Quest*, I led the design and development of a web-based fitness tracking platform that helps users set goals, log progress, and improve their overall health. The platform includes interactive questionnaires to assess fitness levels, progress logs for tracking workouts, nutrition tracking for meal planning, and achievement badges to keep users engaged.  

To build this system, we used SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and AJAX to create a dynamic and responsive experience. I optimized key workflows, making the system 20% more efficient and reducing data processing times. By analyzing user interactions, I identified areas for improvement, enhancing navigation and usability. Additionally, I developed and tested six financial analytics tools within the platform, helping users make informed decisions about fitness-related expenses, increasing decision-making efficiency by 30%.

- **SQL** – Managed and structured fitness and user data.  
- **PHP** – Developed the backend logic and database interactions.  
- **HTML & CSS** – Designed and styled the user interface for a clean and responsive experience.
