![ETL Payroll System](/assets/erd.png){:width="700px"} 

As part of a development team, we followed the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to design and implement an **ETL payroll system** aimed at automating and streamlining payroll processing. This project involved thorough system analysis, followed by the design and implementation of a database system to manage employee payroll data efficiently.  



We also worked on creating solutions for automating data tasks and improving user interaction with the system. The improvements led to more efficient workflows and a significant reduction in manual tasks, allowing payroll staff to focus on more strategic functions. The result was a more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly payroll system.

## Technologies & Methodologies Used  
- **Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** – Followed a structured approach, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.  
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** – Designed in **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** with primary/foreign keys, cardinalities, and modalities.  
- **SQL & Automation** – Created optimized SQL scripts to automate payroll data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).  

## Key Achievements  
- Designed ERDs in **3NF**, ensuring data integrity and efficient database performance.  
- Recommended **5 system improvements**, increasing workflow efficiency by **20%**.  
- Developed training materials for **3 system updates**, improving user adoption by **25%**.  
- Automated recurring data tasks using optimized SQL scripts, saving **10+ hours** of manual work per week.
