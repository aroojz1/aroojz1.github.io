As part of a development team, I contributed to the design and implementation of a **hotel database management system**. The system was developed to efficiently manage hotel operations, including reservations, customer data, and financial transactions. Our goal was to streamline workflows and provide quick access to critical business data.  

We utilized **SQL** to optimize database queries and improve reporting capabilities. I played a key role in reducing report generation time by 50%, resolving system issues to enhance database performance, and producing reports that improved operational processes. The system led to increased accuracy in the hotel’s operations and better decision-making for management.

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL** – Designed and optimized queries for efficient data retrieval.  
- **Stored Procedures & Queries** – Developed stored procedures for automated report generation.  
- **Database Design** – Built normalized tables and relationships for optimal data structure.  

## Key Achievements  
- Reduced report generation time by **50%** with SQL queries, improving reporting efficiency by **35%**.  
- Resolved **6+ system issues**, enhancing database performance and reducing errors by **20%**.  
- Produced **3 operational reports**, improving processes and boosting data accuracy by **10%**.
