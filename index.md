A recent graduate from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I received a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems and was awarded academic major honors.

I have experience working as a financial intern at Ameriprise and a teacher, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams. Here are some of my [projects](https://saqnaz4.github.io/portfolio/)

Down the line, I hope to work in a cross-functional role, ideally as a Product Manager, where I can leverage my business and analytical experience as a supplement to my technical background. The intersection of software and hardworking **healthcare** professionals fascinates me, and I seek to develop progressive products that aid humanity as we move toward an increasingly digital age.
