I’m a BS Information Technology student at The Islamia University of Bahawalpur with a growing passion for healthcare data analytics. My studies and projects have strengthened my skills in Statistics, Database Systems, Machine Learning, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, enabling me to turn data into meaningful insights.

I have experience working as a financial intern at Ameriprise and a teacher, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams. Here are some of my [projects](https://aroojz1.github.io/portfolio/)

Looking ahead, I hope to work as a Healthcare Data Analyst, using data-driven insights to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and support digital transformation in healthcare systems. I’m especially inspired by the intersection of technology and healthcare — where data can truly help humanity.
