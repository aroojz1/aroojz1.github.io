I am an Information Systems graduate with a strong foundation in data analysis, public health informatics, and technology-driven solutions. Passionate about leveraging data to improve healthcare outcomes, I thrive in analytical environments where I can apply my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI to extract insights, optimize workflows, and drive decision-making.

Beyond academics, I have engaged in various projects focused on healthcare informatics, database design, and fitness tracking, demonstrating my ability to build practical, data-driven applications. My experience as a Financial Analyst Intern at Ameriprise strengthened my analytical skills, while my role as an Assistant Teacher helped me develop mentorship and communication abilities.

Additionally, my involvement in student organizations such as the UMBC Software Development and Administration Club and the Hiking Club has enhanced my leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. With a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, I am eager to contribute my expertise in public health data science, health informatics, and data analysis to create meaningful impact in the healthcare industry.
